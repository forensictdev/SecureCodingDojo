Sensitive data exposure occurs when confidential or private information is unintentionally exposed to unauthorized entities, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, or manipulation. This can result from weak encryption, improper storage practices, or inadequate access controls.

###### Spotting Problems in Source Code (Based on OWASP Secure Code Review)

When conducting a secure code review with a focus on sensitive data exposure, consider the following:

####### Data Encryption:

- **Check for Weak Encryption:** Review encryption mechanisms to ensure they meet industry standards. Weak or outdated encryption algorithms can lead to data exposure.

####### Storage Practices:

- **Evaluate Data Storage:** Assess how sensitive data is stored. Insecure storage practices, such as storing passwords in plaintext, can lead to exposure.

- **Database Security:** Review database configurations for secure storage of sensitive information, such as using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

####### Access Controls:

- **Assess Access Controls:** Verify that access controls are implemented correctly. Inadequate access controls may allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data.

####### Secure Transmission:

- **Review Data Transmission:** Ensure that sensitive data is transmitted securely over networks. Insecure transmission methods can expose data to interception.

####### Logging and Auditing:

- **Check Logging Practices:** Examine logging mechanisms to ensure they don't inadvertently log sensitive information. Log entries should be appropriately sanitized.

####### Third-party Components:

- **Assess Dependencies:** Review third-party components for secure handling of sensitive data. Insecure third-party libraries can introduce vulnerabilities.

####### Error Handling:

- **Examine Error Messages:** Check error handling mechanisms to avoid exposing sensitive details in error messages. Errors should provide minimal information to users.


By systematically reviewing these aspects in the source code, developers and security experts can identify and address vulnerabilities related to sensitive data exposure, enhancing the overall security posture of the software application.
