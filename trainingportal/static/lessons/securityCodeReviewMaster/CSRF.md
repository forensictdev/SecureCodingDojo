Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a web security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a user's browser into unknowingly submitting a request on a web application in which the user is authenticated. The attacker exploits the trust that a website has in the user's browser by tricking it into making an unwanted request, often resulting in actions that the user did not intend.

###### How to Spot Problems in Source Code (Based on OWASP Secure Code Review)

When conducting a secure code review with a focus on CSRF, consider the following aspects:

####### Lack of Anti-CSRF Tokens:

- Review Form Submissions: Check whether forms that perform sensitive actions lack the inclusion of anti-CSRF tokens.

####### Inadequate SameSite Cookie Configuration:

- Cookie Attributes: Assess whether cookies lack the SameSite attribute or are improperly configured, potentially exposing them to CSRF attacks.

####### Absence of Referer Header Checking:

- Validate Referer Header: Check if the application validates the Referer header to ensure that requests originate from the expected source.

####### Missing Custom Headers:

- Include Custom Headers: Evaluate whether custom headers are included in requests to add an additional layer of validation on the server side.

####### Improper Handling of State-Changing Requests:

- Review State-Changing Actions: Examine how the application handles state-changing requests, especially those that can have significant impact, to identify potential CSRF vulnerabilities.

###### Adherence to OWASP Guidelines:

- Compliance with OWASP Recommendations: Ensure that the code aligns with OWASP guidelines for preventing CSRF attacks, including the implementation of secure coding practices and recommended mitigation strategies.

By systematically reviewing these aspects in the source code, developers and security experts can identify and address vulnerabilities related to CSRF, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions and maintaining the security of web applications.
