Sensitive data exposure occurs when an application, system, or network inadvertently exposes confidential or private information to unauthorized entities. This exposure can result from inadequate protection mechanisms, such as weak encryption or improper storage, making sensitive data vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, or manipulation.

Common types of sensitive data include personal identification information (PII), financial details, and login credentials. Effective protection against sensitive data exposure involves implementing robust encryption, secure storage practices, and ensuring that proper access controls are in place to restrict unauthorized access.

Detecting and addressing potential vulnerabilities in handling sensitive data is essential for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of user information, mitigating the risk of data breaches, and complying with privacy regulations and standards.
