Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a web security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a user's browser into unknowingly submitting a request on a web application in which the user is authenticated. The attacker exploits the trust that a website has in the user's browser by tricking it into making an unwanted request, often resulting in actions that the user did not intend.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Unintended Actions:** CSRF attacks lead to unintended actions performed on behalf of an authenticated user without their explicit consent.

- **Trusted User Context:** The attacker exploits the fact that the user's browser includes credentials (e.g., session cookies) for a particular site, allowing them to impersonate the user.

- **Commonly Targeted Actions:** CSRF attacks often target actions with significant impact, such as changing account settings, making financial transactions, or modifying data.

### Mitigation Strategies:

To prevent CSRF attacks, developers can implement the following mitigation strategies:

- **Anti-CSRF Tokens:** Use unique tokens in each form or request to verify the legitimacy of the request.

- **SameSite Cookies:** Utilize the SameSite attribute in cookies to control when cookies are sent in a cross-site request.

- **Referer Header Checking:** Validate the Referer header to ensure that requests originate from the expected source.

- **Custom Headers:** Include custom headers in requests that are checked on the server side.

Understanding and implementing these strategies is crucial for mitigating the risk of CSRF attacks and maintaining the integrity of web applications.
